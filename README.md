# Drowsiness-Detector
Around 100,000 people die or get severely injured each year world-wide due to Drowsy driving. Drowsy driving is when people feel fatigue or sleepy while driving. They are unconscious, and that leads to accidents, deaths and other big consequences. To prevent that, I made a Drowsiness detector that checks whether a driver is feeling drowsy or not, and if they are, then this system will play an alarm to awake the driver.
